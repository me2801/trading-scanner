### Detailed Key Notes

| Channel | Key Notes |
|--------|-----------|
| **@BTheStory** (B The Trader) | Best for process, review discipline, and “how to teach.” Treat as execution hygiene + content packaging, not an edge source. |
| **@ScarfaceTrades** | High risk of “strategy surfing.” Only useful if you convert content into explicit rules + backtest/forward-test; otherwise time sink. |
| **@moondevonyt** (Moon Dev) | Strongest overlap with your **Polymarket + automation + SaaS scanner** flow. Watch only when you will ship an artifact (script/feature/test). |
| **@TheTradingParrot** | Use as an occasional idea source. Extract one mechanic at a time; do not adopt full strategies without validation. |
| **@AraKerbabian** | Potentially useful if you actively trade **XAU/FX**. Keep only what you can make auditable (entry/exit/invalidation/sizing). |
| **@ToriTrades** | Works as a pattern library, but dangerous for style-hopping. Consume only with a specific question you’re trying to solve. |
| **@QuantifiedStrategies** | Your “anti-guru anchor.” Best for building auditable playbooks: expectancy, drawdown control, regime filters, rule clarity. |
| **@michaelionita** | More “portfolio automation” than prop. Useful when you’re in long-term systems mode; weaker direct FTMO passing relevance. |
| **@garland.trader** | Default skip. If watched at all, treat as marketing/packaging study, not strategy learning. |
| **@DappUniversity** | Strong if you want crypto/web3 optionality and to ship tools; not a trading-edge channel. |

### Summary Recommendations
Top to follow: **QuantifiedStrategies, Moon Dev**.  
Selective follow (for process/teaching): **BTheStory**.  
Moderate/optional (only with strict “extract → rules → test” discipline): **AraKerbabian, ToriTrades, TheTradingParrot, michaelionita, DappUniversity**.  
Skip by default: **ScarfaceTrades, garland.trader**.

### Commentary (same decision rule for every channel)
| Rule | What it prevents | What you do instead |
|------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Two-channel rule (30 days)** | Flow-driven hopping | Pick 2 active channels/month; everything else is search-only. |
| **One-output-per-video** | Passive consumption | Every video must produce an artifact: a rule spec, a backtest, or a journal checklist update. |
| **Auditable-or-trash** | Discretionary fog | If you can’t write entry/exit/invalidation/sizing, you skip it. |
| **Cap experiments** | Overfitting | 1 hypothesis/week → 1 test → ship/shelve decision. |

### Suggested Additional Channels (high ROI adds)
| Channel | Overall | Best For | Why it fits you |
|---|---:|---|---|
| **FTMO (official)** | 8 | FTMO/Prop | Prop constraints, risk rules, and mindset aligned with passing challenges. |
| **Coding Jesus** | 8 | Quant Hiring + SaaS | Portfolio/repo quality, engineering habits, quant/dev career angle. |
| **Fancy Quant (Dimitri Bianco)** | 8 | Quant Hiring | Hiring signals + research workflow clarity (what actually matters). |
| **Hudson & Thames** | 8 | Quant Research | Research discipline + statistics framing (great antidote to guru content). |
| **Ben Felix** | 8 | Long-Term Investing | Evidence-based investing; helps keep Box strategy sane and simple. |
| **SMB Capital** | 7 | Trading Process | Process, review loops, skill-building; less instrument-specific but strong hygiene. |
| **PredictionMarketTrader** | 7 | PolyMarket | Cleaner prediction-market focus vs. generic trading channels. |

## Where I disagree with Grok (and why)

1) **PolyMarket scores for Moon Dev and others**
- Grok gave Moon Dev **PolyMarket = 4**. I disagree: it should be **8–9** because Moon Dev is one of the *few* on your list that is directly “build bots / automation / prediction-market execution” adjacent. For your goals (2) and (4), that’s unusually high leverage.
- For most of the other listed channels, Grok’s **PolyMarket = 4** is fair: they’re trading channels, not prediction-market mechanics.

2) **FTMO/Prop scores for B The Trader**
- Grok gave **FTMO/Prop = 9** for B The Trader. I’d mark it **6–7**. Reason: B’s strength is *process, psychology, interviews, routines*. That helps passing indirectly, but it’s not instrument-specific, rule-specific, or “auditable edge” content for XAU/XAG/BTC/ETH/SOL/XRP.

3) **“Follow” call on ScarfaceTrades**
- Grok says **Follow** (FTMO day trading). I say **default Skip / very selective**. Reason: your biggest enemy is *strategy hopping* + *non-auditable discretionary tactics*. Channels with lots of “one strategy / win-rate / big claims” content often produce **confidence without evidence**. If you do watch: only to extract a single rule and test it.

4) **QuantifiedStrategies = 10**
- I agree it’s top-tier, but I’d avoid “10” framing because it can trigger overconsumption. Risk: you’ll start endlessly testing variants instead of shipping a stable rule-set + monthly review. So: **follow**, but with strict caps (1 hypothesis/week, 1 notebook, 1 decision).

5) **Moon Dev: Grok’s SaaS=10, Quant Hiring=9**
- I mostly agree on SaaS strength, but I’d temper quant-hiring impact slightly unless you translate it into: clean repos, tests, research notes, and a coherent narrative. Moon Dev is great for building; hiring still requires packaging + evidence.

6) **Ara Kerbabian / ToriTrades rated “Skip” by Grok**
- I’m less absolute. I’d label them **“optional pattern library”** if—and only if—you are currently grinding XAU/FX entries and can convert ideas into auditable rules (entry/exit/invalidation/sizing). Otherwise, skip is correct.

7) **DappUniversity recommendation**
- Grok says follow if web3/crypto flow; I agree. I’d emphasize: it won’t improve trading expectancy directly, but it can materially improve your **crypto/web3 hiring optionality** and **product velocity**.

Net: Grok is broadly right on “QuantifiedStrategies + Moon Dev are core.” My differences are mainly (a) PolyMarket relevance (Moon Dev much higher), (b) downgrading “prop edge” claims for interview/process channels, and (c) being harsher on “guru-ish” follow recommendations to protect you from time-loss.
